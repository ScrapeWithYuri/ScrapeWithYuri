### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have over nine years of experience as a CPA accountant, programmer, and educator. I am currently a [controller at AI Fund](https://aifund.ai/team-member/yuri-douglas/) and a [freelancer programmer at UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d1c41e6478fca071). As an accountant, I am experienced in the private equity and venture capital accounting, including fund & management company accounting, SEC compliance, portfolio company valuations, human resoures, and payroll. As a freelance programmer, I specialize in building automations and integrations in Python, VBA, and Google Scripts, and I've consulted with over 100 clients throughout the world.

I also have two online courses:
